Users decide what to eat based on the time of day they enter . When the user types a time (like "Morning" or "Night snack") into the input field and presses the "Suggest Meal" button, the app checks the input and provides a meal suggestion.  an example, if the user enters "Morning," the app suggests eggs, bacon, toast, and orange juice. If they enter "Mid-afternoon," it recommends a  snack like biscuits and tea. If the input doesnâ€™t match any valid time, the app responds with an Invalid message, prompting the user to enter a correct time category.

There's also a reset button that clears both the EditText and the TextView, and makes the default message appear .
